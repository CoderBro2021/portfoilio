        <p>My hobby is to do coding. Whenever I get free time, I do coding. Through coding, I make different types of apps of which help me in my daily life. I am 11 years old and a 7th grader.
            I learn coding from Whitehat junior. I have done 57 class till now, and I will do more. I do coding in code.org, thunkable, codepen.io, Gooogle firebase, Brackets[]. And I will do in another platforms also. Coding makes my mind sharp, expert and active. Now times, I don't play games, I make games. And my long term goal is to become a tech scientist. I was so indulged in coding that previous month, my father bought a Hp laptop for me. Now I do coding. I Just love to do coding.
